# BathLARP Backend

This is the API backend for the BathLARP website.

## Getting Started

### VS Code devcontainers

The easiest way to get started with this application is using VS Code
devcontainers.

Prerequisites:

- Docker (other container runtimes may also work, but haven't been tried)
- VS Code

Steps:

- Clone the repository to a location of your choice.
- Copy `example.env` to `.env`.
- Open the project in VS Code.
- When prompted, choose to reopen in container.

This may take a while the first time while the necessary images are downloaded,
but eventually you should have a development environment up and running,
complete with a database server.
